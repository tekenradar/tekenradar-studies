# Tekenradar study and survey definitions

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- `node` and `npm` must be installed.

### Installation

- Checkout the git repository.

- To install dependencies run:

```sh
npm install
```

### Normal use

Edit the content for example inside `src/studies/tekenradar` as you wish.

To run the script to generate all the configuration files, you can use:

```sh
npm start
```

The results will be generated inside the `output` folder.
The output folder is not tracked by git, so if you want to store intermediate results of the generated JSON files, you need to do it outside of this repository.
